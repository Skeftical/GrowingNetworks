# Growing Networks

This is an implementation of the algorithm listed in the paper "*A self-organising network that grows when required*" [1]. This algorithm can be used for clustering tasks, vector quantization tasks and dimensionality reduction tasks. See Self-Organising Maps [2].

There is a Jupyter-Notebook included which shows the comparison of this algorithms with other well-known clustering algorithms (using the examples from [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)), and network visualisations (using [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/))
